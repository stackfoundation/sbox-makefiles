# sbox-makefiles
Simple C and Makefile example with Sandbox

Try out the simple workflows by cloning the repo, and running them using Sandbox (already included in the repo):
```
git clone https://github.com/stackfoundation/sbox-makefiles.git
cd sbox-makefiles
./sbox run build-app
```

That built the hello world C app, you can build and run with another workflow:
```
./sbox run run-app
```

Try running a simple hello world bash script:
```
./sbox run hello-script
```

If you have issues running Sandbox, please help us by filing an issue in the [Sandbox GitHub repo](https://github.com/stackfoundation/sandbox)!
